## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Fetch API
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I could recap a lot of things building this one and I fell excited moving forward for more challenges. I didn't use mobile-first design principles but I was able to realize some things to start with it in my next project. I haven't used anything but pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript and it made me feel like I could make it faster if I have used frameworks. Perhaps now I can finally start to grow my knowledge about them.

### Continued development

Now I plan to start using mobile-first design principles as well creating pages with react.
